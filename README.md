# Hister

**Your own search engine**

Hister is a general purpose web search engine providing automatic full-text indexing for visited websites.

## Features

- **Privacy-focused**: Keep your browsing history indexed locally - don't use remote search engines if it isn't necessary
- **Full-text indexing**: Search through the actual content of web pages you've visited
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Utilize a powerful [query language](https://hister.org/docs/query-language) for precise results
- **Local file indexing**: Index your local knowledge base
- **Crawler**: Use a (headless) browser or a traditional crawler to extend your index fast
- **Multi-user support**: Host it for your local community
- **AI enhanced**: Enable optional semantic search or connect your agents via MCP

## Development

**Requirements**: latest Go and [Bun](https://bun.sh)

- Clone the repository
- Build with `./manage.sh build` (or `go generate ./...; go build`)

To work on the web app with hot reload and automatic Go rebuilds:

```
bun run serve:app
```

This starts a Vite dev server (with HMR) and the Go backend (with auto-rebuild via [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)) concurrently.
